## Examples of Great Requests

### Example 1: Clear Bug Report
**Title**: [BUG] Can't register students for Basketball Team
**Problem**: When I try to register Sarah Jones (sarah@mergington.edu) for Basketball Team, I get error "Authentication required" even though I'm logged in as mrodriguez
**Expected**: Sarah should be added to the team and I should see confirmation
**Steps**: 1) Login as mrodriguez 2) Click Basketball Team 3) Enter sarah@mergington.edu 4) Click Register

### Example 2: Detailed Feature Request  
**Title**: [FEATURE] Add waitlist for popular activities
**Description**: When activities fill up (like Drama Club), students should be able to join a waitlist. If someone drops out, the first waitlisted student automatically gets the spot and receives an email notification.
**Why needed**: Currently 15+ students miss out on Drama Club every semester, and I manually track interested students on paper.

## School Context

**Remember:** Our system serves Mergington High School specifically:
- **Students**: Grades 9-12, about 400-600 total students  
- **Schedule**: August to May, 3 trimesters plus optional summer
- **Email format**: firstname@mergington.edu
- **School motto**: "Branch out and grow"

This context helps the coding agent make appropriate decisions for our school environment.
