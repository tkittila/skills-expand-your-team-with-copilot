        ## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Context for Copilot Agent
        
        **School Information:**
        - School: Mergington High School 
        - Users: Teachers (for registration) and Students (for viewing)
        - Email format: firstname@mergington.edu
        
        **Common Bug Areas:**
        - Authentication: Check teacher login validation in `/src/backend/routers/auth.py`
        - Registration: Check signup logic in `/src/backend/routers/activities.py`
        - Data display: Check frontend JavaScript in `/src/static/app.js`
        - Database: Check data initialization in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - UI: Check styling and responsive design in `/src/static/styles.css`
        
        **Debugging Hints:**
        - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
        - Verify API endpoints return expected data format
        - Test with sample data: teachers (mrodriguez/art123, mchen/chess456)
        - Validate email format and authentication requirements
        - Ensure MongoDB connection and data persistence
        
        **Testing:**
        - Test fix with multiple browsers and devices
        - Verify all user roles (students viewing, teachers registering)
        - Check edge cases (full activities, invalid emails, etc.)
