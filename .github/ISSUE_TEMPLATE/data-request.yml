        ## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Context for Copilot Agent
        
        **Data Sources:**
        - Activity data: `initial_activities` in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Teacher data: `initial_teachers` in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Live participant lists stored in MongoDB collections
        - Registration timestamps and status information
        
        **Available Data Fields:**
        - Activities: name, description, schedule, max_participants, current participants
        - Schedule: days, start_time, end_time (24-hour format)
        - Participants: email addresses (format: firstname@mergington.edu)
        - Teachers: username, display_name, role
        
        **Implementation Options:**
        - Add new API endpoint for data export: `/activities/export` or `/reports/[type]`
        - Create data formatting functions in backend
        - Generate CSV/JSON output that can be saved as Excel
        - Add frontend interface for teachers to request reports
        - Consider adding download links or email delivery
        
        **Privacy Considerations:**
        - Student email addresses are included - ensure appropriate access controls
        - Consider teacher authentication requirements for sensitive data
        - May need to log who requested what data and when
        
        **Technical Notes:**
        - Current data is in-memory (MongoDB collections)
        - Data format is consistent and structured
        - Export functions should handle empty activities gracefully
        - Consider adding date/time stamps to exported data
