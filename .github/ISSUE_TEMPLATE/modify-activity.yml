        ## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Context for Copilot Agent
        
        **School Information:**
        - School: Mergington High School (grades 9-12) 
        - School year: August to May, 3 trimesters + optional summer cycle
        - Motto: "Branch out and grow"
        
        **Technical Hints:**
        - Modify activity in `initial_activities` dictionary in `/src/backend/database.py`
        - Preserve existing participant data unless specifically requested to change
        - Update activity key if name changes (may require data migration)
        - Use 24-hour time format for schedule_details (e.g., "15:30" for 3:30 PM)
        - Test changes appear correctly in web interface filters and displays
        
        **Limitations:**
        - Changes only persist until server restart (in-memory storage)
        - Cannot reduce max_participants below current enrollment without handling participants
        - Schedule changes should respect school hours (6:00 AM - 9:00 PM)
        - Activity key changes may affect existing URLs/bookmarks
